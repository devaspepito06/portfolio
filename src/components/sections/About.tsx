					<h1>Hi, I'm Brayan Ocampo</h1>
					<p>
						I'm a software analyst and developer, and I'm passionate about web
						UI programming. I have three years of experience developing websites
						using various JavaScript frameworks and libraries, such as ReactJS
						and NextJS. I love creating interfaces from designs using
						pixel-perfect techniques. I'm a minimalist professional. I'm a
						capable leader with a strong imagination and creativity for solving
						challenges. I enjoy teamwork, building large projects, sharing
						ideas, and listening to others. I love anime, traditional Japanese
						style, and Linux.
